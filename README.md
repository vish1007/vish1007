## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 📌 [Glacier Lake Segmentation from Remote Sensing Data using NAU-Net and SAM](https://github.com/vish1007/GlacialLake-Segmentation-RemoteSensed-UNet-SAM)
*June 2024 – June 2025*  
IEEE IGARSS Paper Accepted 🏅  
Developed a slope-aware segmentation framework enhanced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to detect glacial lakes in the Eastern Himalayas using Landsat imagery and DEM. Achieved significant performance improvements in lake boundary accuracy.
---
### 📌 [Multimodal Image Classification using Text-Guided Features for Disaster Response](https://github.com/your-repo-link)

*June 2024 – June 2025*
Disaster AI for Social Media Monitoring 🌐📱
Built a multimodal deep learning pipeline to classify disaster-related social media content by combining visual and textual cues from real-time tweets. The framework supports rapid disaster response by accurately labeling and prioritizing critical information.

📁 **Dataset**
Leveraged a publicly available dataset of annotated tweets from real-world disasters, containing:

* **Images**: Extracted directly from tweets during emergency events.
* **Text**: Captions and descriptions accompanying the tweets.
* **Labels**: Human-assigned categories such as *Informative*, *Non-informative*, and *Humanitarian Purposes* (e.g., infrastructure damage, rescue effort).

Achieved high classification accuracy by integrating CLIP-style text-image embeddings, enabling semantic understanding of disaster scenarios.

### 📧 [Email Campaign Effectiveness Prediction](https://github.com/vish1007/Email-Campaign-Effectiveness-Prediction)
*Aug 2023 – Nov 2023*  
Predicted email campaign success using engineered features and SMOTE. Achieved a **0.757 F1 Score** with a Random Forest model. Discovered that shorter emails with less imagery are more effective!

---

### 🏏 [IPL Data Analysis (2008–2022)](https://github.com/vish1007/IPL-Data-Analysis-2008-2022)
*Sep 2023 – Nov 2023*  
Designed a relational database and interactive dashboard to explore IPL match and delivery-level data. Uncovered insights like team-wise win rates and top-performing players.

---

### ❤️ [Cardiovascular Risk Prediction](https://github.com/vish1007/Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction-)
*Dec 2022 – Mar 2023*  
Developed a robust CHD risk predictor with **89.3% ROC AUC** using Random Forest. Key predictors: smoking, diabetes, hypertension, BMI, education level.

---

### 🛍️ [Retail Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/vish1007/Rossmann-Retail-Sales-Prediction/blob/main/Rossman_Retail_Sales_Prediction.ipynb)
*Oct 2022 – Nov 2022*  
Used regression models like Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest to forecast retail sales. Achieved **93.6% model accuracy**.

---

### 🏠 [NYC Airbnb Booking EDA](https://github.com/vish1007/NYC-E.D.A-on-Airbnb-Booking-Analysis)
*Aug 2022 – Sep 2022*  
Analyzed pricing, availability, and user preferences across NYC Airbnb listings. Suggested strategies to boost host performance using data-driven visuals.
